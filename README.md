# Maestro
CS497 Personal Project

## 1 Project Proposal

**(a) Project title?** For example: “Search Engine using Apache Lucene”, or “High- Performance Web Framework using Dart”.
 		
		 Maestro: An Online Media Storage Platform Built with Ruby on Rails
		 
**(b) What is it going to do?** For example: “Trans-compile a style sheet into mobile- friendly equivalent”, 
    “a chat client that uses Node.js to facilitate communication between several instant message protocols”, 
    “an HTTP proxy designed to make web browsing more anonymous”, etc. Be detailed and specific. 	
		
		Maestro is a subscription based web application allowing users to store, manage, and stream their digital media.
		
**(c) Who is the target audience?** For example: The general public, developers, co-workers, research scientists, students, etc.
		
		The target audience would be the general public, specifically any individual looking to safeguard their digital media
		while still desiring to interact with it at anytime from any internet-connected location.

**(d) What sort of data will it manage?** Think of any data that will be dynamically generated. 
	For example: user comments, uploaded images, credit cards, API responses, sensor data, etc. 
		
		The application will manage all content associated with the user's digital library this
		includes, video, audio, documents, and user specific information for the purposes of 
		subscription based billing.
	
**(e) What web technologies will it use?** List all technologies you plan to use. This list can grow or shrink over the course 
	of the semester, and be based on your needs. But the main technologies shouldn’t change. This is a good opportunity to 
	branch out from something familiar and try using a new language or framework. For example: “My project will use Go, PostgreSQL, 
	Ext JS, and Concise” or “Facebook’s React framework with MySQL.” This may take a bit of research to figure out what will be a
	good fit for your application.
	
		Maestro will be built using the Ruby on Rails framework. It will be hosted using the cedar stack on Heroku and will
		store user data in a backend postgres database. Payment processing will be accomplished using Stripe. Domain services will
		be provided by dns simple.

**(f) Stretch Goals?** Once your project is fully functional and demonstrates adequate scope, what extra features do you want to implement? 
	What additional gold plating would make your application utterly awesome? Stretch goals aren’t part of your grade, but your own 
	satisfaction.
		
		Provide basic in-app editiing of user uploaded documents.

## 2 Category Requirements

**(a) Is it a website?**

	My project best falls under the category of a website and will be hosted publicly.
